plag
====

My personal blog, to be hosted at http://www.Geek.Co.Ke/

This project named ``Plag' so that it appears intentionally to be a contortion of the word ``Blog'' but with a fake American accent ``Bl√¶g''. The letter ``B'' at the beginning is replaced with a ``P'' for reasons of cultural solidarity :-P 

*Requirements* 

The following are the plag's dependencies: 

* Python releases 2.7.* or 3.2.* and above, 
* Django versions 1.6 and above, 
* pip and distools, 
* Markdown for Python, 
* django-TinyMCE, 
* _Wish list:_ Modules for integration of a commenting system (disqus) and R.S.S feeds. 

*Licensing*
